## Summary

I've wasted a lot of time on this stupid gotcha game called "Snowbreak: Containment Zone"...
But actually most of my daily grind can be done by scripts, so here I am, trying to implement my
own script that help me doing daily missions.

> There must be many awesome tools/scripts out there that does this already, but making my own should be more fun~ (Might never finish this though)
