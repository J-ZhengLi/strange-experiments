> Just some personal fun projects to remind me why did I choose to be a programmer.

Well, since I have a very short attention span, it's often embarrassing seeing all those unfinished project in my repositories...
Then when I look back I always got confused of wth are those and why I did it ðŸ¤·.

So I decided to put all my programming ideas (and implementation) in one repository, hope one day any of them will come in handy,
even though I might never make a finished project by then lol...
